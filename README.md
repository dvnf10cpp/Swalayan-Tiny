## Getting Started

### Welcome to the Swalayan Tiny!

This project is a project to fulfill my modul assignment.
<br/>
It has users.txt and groceries.txt as a file to save data and process that happened in the system.
<br/>
It's also has login and authentication system to make sure no one can breach your account!
<br/>
To play with this demo system, simply just download this whole repostitory and run the App.java
<br/>
If you found bugs in this system, lemme know ^_^

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `Handlers`: the folder to maintain logic,process and handlers that happened in the system
- `DataStructure`: the folder to maintain data structure that i made to develop this system easier
- `Database`: the folder to maintain databases that i use and objects template file
- `Routes`: the folder to maintain system routes

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
