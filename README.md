## Getting Started

### Welcome to the Swalayan Tiny!

This project is a project to fulfill my modul assignment.
<br/>
It has users.txt and groceries.txt as a file to save data and process that happened in the system.
<br/>
It's also has login and authentication system to make sure no one can breach your account
<br/>
To play with this demo system, simply just download this whole repostitory and run the App.java
<br/>
If you found bugs, lemme know ^_^

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
